This repo contains some practice code to learn C, git, and vim.

The repo is structured alike the book chapter from which the code is taken from, which is:
	"C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide, Third Edition" by G. Perry and D. Miller.

Amendment 2022-07-30:

This repo now contains all explicit practice exercises from the book. It was meant as an introduction for me to the
OG of all-purpose programming languages -- C. 
What is left to do now?

1. The book contains a Draw-Poker game as code.
It apparently contains all concept used in the book. However, due to the age of the book and some complaint from the gcc
(i.e. I DON'T WANT YOU TO USE gets()), I suspect it'll be a pain to get it to work. Also, I don't want to copy code and analyse it anymore, I want to come up with some of my own. Thus, I will graciously ignore said program. For now.

2. Revise all the chapters.
Some of the chapters in the last fifths (roughly) of the book were making my gcc complain about specific functions. After quick research it turned out that the authors used deprecated functions (such as gets()). I started to distrust the usefulness a little bit --which lead to the omission of some synopses in the skeleton-headers. For completeness sake, those **should** be added; Revising the material can only reinforce the concepts and will make it easier to me to use those programs as reference.

As of now, I will consider this exercise completed. Off to other projects!
